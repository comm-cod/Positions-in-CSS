Difference between Absolute and Relative:-
The first visible difference between them is related to the syntax.
[1] One uses "position: absolute;" while the other uses "position: relative;"
[2] In position absolute the element can be moved to top, bottom, right and left with relative positioning while in position relative an element is positioned relative to its nearest elements.
[3] position absolute do not break any normal document flow while in position relative, it will break the normal document.
